## Ethical Statement

### Data Source Compliance
- **Data source**: USDA FoodData Central API (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)
- **Access**: Public API with free registration
- **Terms of Service**: All API usage complies with USDA FoodData Central terms and rate limits (1,000 requests/hour)
- **Data type**: Open, public nutritional data with no personally identifiable information (PII)

### Responsible Data Practices
- **API Key Security**: API keys are stored securely using environment variables and never committed to version control
- **Data Provenance**: Every dataset generated is logged with parameters, timestamps, and SHA-256 hashes in `DATA_README.md`
- **Reproducibility**: All collection parameters are documented to enable independent verification
- **Attribution**: Data sourced from USDA FoodData Central is properly credited

### Research Context
- **Purpose**: Educational demonstration of ethical data collection for CSC 786 course
- **Scope**: Analysis of nutritional content in commonly wasted restaurant foods
- **Impact**: Raises awareness about nutritional and environmental costs of food waste
- **Limitations**:
  - Data reflects nutritional content only, not actual waste volumes
  - Food selection based on general waste patterns, not restaurant-specific data
  - Analysis represents snapshot in time based on available API data

### Privacy and Security
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected
- No proprietary or confidential restaurant data is used
- All data is publicly available through official government sources

### Academic Integrity
- This workflow aligns with academic integrity and reproducibility standards at Dakota State University
- All methods, data sources, and limitations are transparently documented
- Code and data are version-controlled for accountability
